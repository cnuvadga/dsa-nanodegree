Runtime Analysis for Unscramble Computer Science Problems
================

The below runtime analyses are Worst Case Big-O approximations.

## Task 0

find first record:  O(1)
find last record:  O(1)

## Task 1

O(n+logn)

## Task 2

Time Complexity - O(n)
This algorithm is linear time because it has one for-loop that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows directly in proportion to n.

## Task 3

O(n + nlogn)
O(n) 

## Task 4

O(n)
