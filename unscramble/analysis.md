Runtime Analysis for Unscramble Computer Science Problems
================

The below runtime analyses are Worst Case Big-O approximations.

## Task 0

Time Complexity - O(1)
This code runs in constant time because indexing into a list is done in constant time


## Task 1

Time Complexity - O(n)
This program runs at linear time because I am looping through each list once


## Task 2

Time Complexity - O(n)
This program runs in linear time because it has one for-loop that iterates from 1 to n which results in a running time grows directly in proportion to n.

## Task 3

This program runs in  O(nlog(n)) time, inspite of the two 'for loops', I have also made use of the sorted function which justifies the time complexity for worst case.


## Task 4

This program aslo run in O(nlog(n)) for worst case. This is justify by the user of the python inbuilt sorted function.
